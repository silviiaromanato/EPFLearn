    "# **Modern NLP: Course project Milestone 3**\n",

    "\n",
    "> ### **Project Description**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Remember**: In **Milestone 1**, we picked a robust prompting stategy to get accurate answers from ChatGPT, which we used to generate answers for questions from EPFL course content. The generated answers were then rated by human annotators. The data collected (available at `project_reference/interactions_v1.json` and `project_reference/solutions_v1.json`) will be used in Milestone 3 for the supervised fine-tuning of a language model to answer questions from EPFL course content.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> However, high-quality assistants such as ChatGPT are trained using more than only\n",
    "supervised learning. They use a technique called Reinforcement Learning with Human\n",
    "Feedback (RLHF). RLHF requires your training procedure to have access to a reward model\n",
    "that can evaluate multiple different responses and rank them according to their suitability. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> In **Milestone 2**, we successfully trained a classifier reward model with the [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) Transformer-based model base on the EPFL and StackOverflow datasets to rate the quality of answers given a question. This model will now be used to train a **policy model** with RLHF to rank multiple answers from the same question.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In **Milestone 3**:, we now fine-tune a generative pretrained language model so that it learns to produce better demonstrations when prompted with a question from your course. We train our model using supervised learning on some of the data we have collected in the first two parts of your project. We also use our reward function to evaluate the quality of the text generations produced by our model. \n"

    "\n",
    "1. **StackOverflow dataset**: The [StackOverflow dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stackoverflow) contains 27M+ answers on a wide variety of forums from which we select 9 topics: computer science, computer science theory, data science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, software engineering, mechanics and quantum physics. We only keep answers that were accepted by the original poster with at least 2 upvotes. This dataset contains 139264 unique questions and their corresponding accepted answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **EPFL Student Interactions dataset**: This dataset contains student interactions with ChatGPT concerning questions on EPFL course content. From this dataset, we select provided official solutions as well as question-answer pairs that were rated with the highest confidence level (5) by students, since using lower quality answers may introduce noise and lead to incorrect responses. We only select one-shot interactions. This dataset contains 4450 questions with 7412 distinct answers. \n",

This fine-tuning step enables the model to specialize in generating accurate and relevant responses for EPFL-specific queries.\n",
